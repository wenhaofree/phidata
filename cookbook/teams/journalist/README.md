# Journalist Workflow

Inspired by the fantastic work by [Matt Shumer (@mattshumer_)](https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1772286375817011259).
We created an open-ended Journalist Workflow that uses 3 GPT-4 Assistants to write an article.
- Searcher: Finds the most relevant articles on the topic
- Writer: Writes a draft of the article
- Editor: Edits the draft to make it more coherent
